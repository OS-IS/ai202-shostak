| 0   | Browser-WebApp-Request | Denial of Service   | An adversary can perform action on behalf of other user due to lack of controls against cross domain requests | Failure to restrict requests originating from third party domains may result in unauthorized actions or access of data                                                                                   |
| 1   | Browser-WebApp-Request | Elevation of Privileges | An adversary may bypass critical steps or perform actions on behalf of other users (victims) due to improper validation logic | Failure to restrict the privileges and access rights to the application to individuals who require the privileges or access rights may result into unauthorized use of data due to inappropriate rights settings and validation. |
| 2   | Browser-WebApp-Request | Information Disclosure | An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content | An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content                                                                                                                                              |
| 13  | Browser-WebApp-Request | Spoofing            | An adversary can steal sensitive data like user credentials | Attackers can exploit weaknesses in system to steal user credentials. Downstream and upstream components are often accessed by using credentials stored in configuration stores. Attackers may steal the upstream or downstream component credentials. Attackers may steal credentials if; Credentials are stored and sent in clear text; Weak input validation coupled with dynamic sql queries; Password retrieval mechanism are poor; |
| 18  | Browser-WebApp-Request | Tampering           | An attacker steals messages off the network and replays them in order to steal a user's session | An attacker steals messages off the network and replays them in order to steal a user's session                                                                                                          |
| 22  | WebApp-DB-Request      | Elevation of Privileges | An adversary can gain unauthorized access to database due to loose authorization rules | Database access should be configured with roles and privilege based on least privilege and need to know principle                                                                                         |
| 26  | WebApp-DB-Request      | Repudiation         | An adversary can deny actions on database due to lack of auditing | Proper logging of all security events and user actions builds traceability in a system and denies any possible repudiation issues. In the absence of proper auditing and logging controls; it would become impossible to implement any accountability in a system.                       |
| 28  | WebApp-DB-Request      | Tampering           | An adversary may leverage the lack of monitoring systems and trigger anomalous traffic to database | An adversary may leverage the lack of intrusion detection and prevention of anomalous database activities and trigger anomalous traffic to database                                                      |
| 29  | WebApp-DB-Response     | Information Disclosure | An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content | An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content                                                                                                                                              |
| 33  | WebApp-DB-Response     | Spoofing            | An adversary can spoof the target web application due to insecure TLS certificate configuration | Ensure that TLS certificate parameters are configured with correct values                                                                                                                                |
